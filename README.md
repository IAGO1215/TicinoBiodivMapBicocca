# TicinoBiodivMapBicocca

These notebooks and source code are dedicated to calculate biodiversity indices of Ticino Park in Italy, which is the first step of this project. The satellite data are from Sentinel-2 and later from PRISMA. The programming languages are mainly python (jupyter notebooks) and partly R (to use some convenient R packages). 

The last step is to validate the calculation results based on the ground truth data collected from field survey.
